# Dynamic_Programming_GFG_20
This repository consists of C++ codes for all the Top 20 Dynamic Programming Problems available in GeeksForGeeks.
I have done the code using C++ language in bottom-up approach with memoization, i.e., using a DP table.
I have focussed on the optimal substructure and solving this subproblems instead of memorizing the recursive function.

Feel free to ping me in case of any errors or other problems.
