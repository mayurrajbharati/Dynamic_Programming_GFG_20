# Dynamic_Programming_GFG_20
Dynamic Programming is used to solve optimization problems. DP follows Principle of Optimality.
This repository consists of C++ codes for all the Top 20 Dynamic Programming Problems available in GeeksForGeeks.
I have done the code using C++ language in bottom-up approach with tabulation, i.e., using a DP table.
I have focussed on the optimal substructure and solving this subproblems instead of memorizing the recursive function.
The main idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we dont have to re-calculate them again.
Feel free to ping me in case of any errors or other problems.
